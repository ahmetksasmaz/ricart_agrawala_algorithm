In distributed systems, ensuring mutual exclusion, where only one process accesses a critical section at a time, is crucial for maintaining data consistency and integrity. However, achieving this while accommodating network communication and node failures presents challenges. The Ricart-Agrawala algorithm addresses these challenges by employing a simple yet effective methodology. When a site requests access to the critical section, it sends a message to all other sites containing its identity and the current timestamp. Upon receiving a request, a site checks if it is not currently using the critical section or if it has a lower priority, in which case it replies immediately; otherwise, it defers the reply until it finishes its own critical section usage. This approach ensures that processes can safely enter the critical section without conflicting access. Additionally, the algorithm minimizes network messages and synchronization delays, enhancing performance.
