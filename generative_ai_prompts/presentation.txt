explain me the advantages of ricart-agrawala algorithm by considering below paragraph, give your explanation as items, keep it simple, the audience may not have proper knowledge

RICART–AGRAWALA ALGORITHM
 Ricart–Agrawala algorithm is an algorithm to for mutual exclusion in a distributed system proposed by Glenn Ricart and Ashok Agrawala.
 This algorithm is an extension and optimization of Lamport’s Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithm.
 It follows permission based approach to ensure mutual exclusion.
 Two type of messages ( REQUEST and REPLY) are used and communication
channels are assumed to follow FIFO order.
 A site send a REQUEST message to all other site to get their permission to enter
critical section.
 A site send a REPLY message to other site to give its permission to enter the critical
section.
 A timestamp is given to each critical section request using Lamport’s logical clock.
 Timestamp is used to determine priority of critical section requests.
 Smaller timestamp gets high priority over larger timestamp.
 The execution of critical section request is always in the order of their timestamp.

Message Complexity:
Ricart–Agrawala algorithm requires invocation of 2(N – 1) messages per critical section execution. These 2(N – 1) messages involve:
 (N – 1) request messages
 (N – 1) reply messages
Performance:
Synchronization delay is equal to maximum message transmission time It requires 2(N – 1) messages per Critical section execution.

The Ricart–Agrawala algorithm is an algorithm for mutual exclusion on a distributed system. This algorithm is an extension and optimization of Lamport's Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithm, by removing the need for
