Paraphrase it, make it simple and one sentence.

Message Complexity: Ricart–Agrawala algorithm requires invocation of 2(N – 1) messages per critical section execution. These 2(N – 1) messages involves

(N – 1) request messages
(N – 1) reply messages

Paraphrase it, make it simple and create a paragraph, CS stands for critical section, clarify that proof is done by contradiction.

Proof: Proof is by contradiction.
 Suppose two sites Si and Sj ‘ are executing the CS concurrently and Si ’s request has higher priority than the request of Sj . Clearly, Si received Sj ’s request after it has made its own request.
 Thus, Sj can concurrently execute the CS with Si only if Si returns a REPLY to Sj (in response to Sj ’s request) before Si exits the CS.
 However, this is impossible because Sj ’s request has lower priority. Therefore, Ricart-Agrawala algorithm achieves mutual exclusion.
